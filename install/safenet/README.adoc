# eToken Pro Linux Driver
For licence reasons the driver has to be obtained directly from Gemalto.

Make the file Safenet Authentication Client RPM available in this
directory before building the docker image. Keep the original
versioned filename and symlink it to the generic one referenced in Dockerfile::

    ln -s Linux/Installation/Standard/RPM/x64/RPM-GPG-KEY-SafenetAuthenticationClient RPM-GPG-KEY-SafenetAuthenticationClient
    ln -s Linux/Installation/Standard/RPM/x64/SafenetAuthenticationClient-9.0.43-0.x86_64.rpm SafenetAuthenticationClient_x86_64.rpm
